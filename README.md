## Backend & Microservices Architecture (Golang Focus)

At Awaed, I focus on mission-critical backend systems and distributed architecture:

- **Change Data Capture (CDC):** Engineered a **Golang/gRPC** CDC service for real-time data sync (SQL Server to **Apache Pulsar**) that **reduced response time by 97%** within 6 months.
- **Distributed Systems:** Developed multiple Golang microservices implementing **Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)** patterns and utilizing **Apache Pulsar** for event streaming.
- **Data Reliability:** Implemented event sourcing in Golang, achieving a **90% reduction in data retrieval time** and significantly enhancing data integrity.
- **Observability:** Integrated comprehensive observability with **OpenTelemetry and Grafana** to improve system reliability and debugging.
- **Full Stack & Efficiency:** Engineered scalable web applications with Nuxt, TypeScript, and PHP Laravel. Streamlined development using Git Submodules for shared components, **reducing code duplication by 30%** within 6 months.

## Front-End Excellence & Business Impact

My extensive background as a front-end engineer informs my holistic full-stack approach:

- **Performance Leadership:** Led refactoring initiatives at Andalusia Group, improving web application load times by **60%** and implementing SEO practices that increased organic traffic by **22%** (both within 3 months).
- **Code Modernization:** Utilized **Tailwind CSS** to improve code clarity and **reduce duplication by 50%** within 6 months.
- **User Engagement:** Developed dynamic applications using **React and Angular** at Scripty Team, achieving a **30% increase in user retention** within 12 months, and contributed to over **$20,000 in revenue** via custom WordPress themes.
